# Baseline Data Folder
This folder contains the baseline data used for the Kilowatt Crackdown competition.

Current data is retrieved by using the OSU Energy Dashboard's web API, however, that dashboard's database hasn't had enough time to collect baseline data. For that reason, baseline data is supplied in these CSV files.
